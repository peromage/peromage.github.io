&lt;p>I previously wrote a &lt;a href="https://peromage.github.io/p/use-org-mode-to-manage-my-blog/">post&lt;/a> about managing blog posts with ox-hugo in org mode. I used to follow the recommendation to keep posts under org subtrees. As posts grew, I found that the opening speed is quite slow even I didn&amp;rsquo;t have many pictures inserted. Although managing the entire site within one file does have some convenience, the slowness is something I can&amp;rsquo;t bear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also I feel it a little awkward when I use the subtree style management. I always worried about if the format was correct like how many empty lines between posts or if something was accidentally changed outside of the post that I was editing. And in order to maintain the subtree structure, the actual posts have to be indented (nested), which is not what I like. There are solutions for this nested editing. I used to use &lt;code>org-narrow-to-subtree&lt;/code> when I was editing the post and use &lt;code>widen&lt;/code> to switch the view back. But still, I always worried about the format (please forgive OCD patient).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
