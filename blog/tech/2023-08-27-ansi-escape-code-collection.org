| CSI n A     | CUU – Cursor Up                    | Moves the cursor n (default 1) cells in the given direction. If the cursor is already at the edge of the screen, this has no effect.                                                       |

| CSI n F     | CPL – Cursor Previous Line         | Moves cursor to beginning of the line n (default 1) lines up. (not ANSI.SYS)                                                                                                               |

If n is 2, clear entire screen (and moves cursor to upper left on DOS ANSI.SYS). If n is 3, clear entire screen and delete all lines saved in the scrollback buffer (this feature was added for xterm and is supported by other terminal applications). |
| CSI n K     | EL – Erase in Line                 | Erases part of the line. If n is 0 (or missing), clear from cursor to the end of the line. If n is 1, clear from cursor to beginning of the line. If n is 2, clear entire line. Cursor position does not change. |
